                           constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about<br>
                            the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.<br>

                <h1>EVOLUTION</h1>
                    <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question
                                 of our origins.Where do we come from and how did we get here?<br> 
                                Since Darwin proposed his the ory of evolution we have had a 
                                framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.<br>
                                Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species
                                 we know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet<br>
                                 a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth,
                                  the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>

                               history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs<br>
                                including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.<br>
                                 Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from<br>
                             the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our<br>
                              fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>
