            <h2>EVOLUTION</h2>
            <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have pondered one of humanity’s greatest questions: Where do we come from, and how did we get here? The theory of evolution, first proposed by Charles Darwin, has provided a groundbreaking framework for exploring and understanding our origins and our place in the natural world.</p>

                <p>In this exhibition, you’ll discover the incredible story of life on Earth, from the simplest single-celled organisms to the vast diversity of species that exist today. Learn how life began, adapted, and evolved over millions of years, and explore the forces of natural selection that have shaped the creatures around us</p>
                
                <p>Take a journey through time and meet some of the remarkable species that didn’t survive the test of evolution. From the majestic Woolly Mammoth to the enigmatic Dodo, and of course, the mighty dinosaurs, this exhibition offers a fascinating glimpse into the lives of these lost creatures and the ever-changing nature of life on Earth.</p>
